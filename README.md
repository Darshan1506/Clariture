### Introduction

Clariture is used for real-time surveillance which is a cutting-edge technology that utilizes OpenCV to detect weapons, fire, and violence in real-time. OpenCV is an open-source computer vision library that enables the analysis of visual data, such as images and videos, and is used to create machine learning algorithms that can automatically identify patterns and features.

By integrating AI algorithms with OpenCV, the website will continuously monitor live video feeds from security cameras and detect any suspicious activity, such as the presence of weapons, fire, or violent behavior. This technology has many potential applications, including in public spaces such as airports, train stations, and government buildings, where security is of the utmost importance.
